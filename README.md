**üß† How It Works**

Frontend uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create forms, dashboards, and dynamic sections.

Form validation is implemented using JavaScript regex for email, phone, and PIN code.

Password strength checking dynamically updates a progress bar based on character types (uppercase, lowercase, number, special character).

Student data is stored in a mock database (JavaScript object), simulating backend functionality.

On login, JavaScript checks credentials against the mock database and loads the appropriate dashboard view.

Dashboard sections (Profile, Academic Info, Fees, Support) are dynamically updated using JavaScript DOM manipulation.
